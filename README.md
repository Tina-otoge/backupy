# backupy
Transparent backup solution for your personal storage. Written in modern Python.

## Rationale

Only 15GB of Google storage is free, I want to backup my photos and videos somewhere, but this limit is very easily reached. I have several servers at my
disposal. I want a solution that would allow me to ensure my local collection
is backed up somewhere.

## Features

- Backup from any platform that can run Python
- Create mirrors to avoid data loss when a system inevitably fails
- Sort, rename, rearrange files on the server without creating duplicates when
  the next backup runs
